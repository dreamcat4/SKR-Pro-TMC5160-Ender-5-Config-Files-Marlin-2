## Installation guide for Printers with BL Touch 3.1

1. Get the latest Marlin bugfix-2.0.x from the official site here: http://marlinfw.org/meta/download/.

2. Copy files from folder **\Config_BLTouch31\Config_Files** in this repository to the folder **\Marlin** in your firmware root folder.

3. Copy files from folder **\Config_BLTouch31\Compiler_Settings** in this repository to the your firmware root folder.

4. Copy files from folder **\Config_BLTouch31\Pins_Files** in this repository to the folder **\Marlin\src\pins\stm32f4** in your firmware root folder.

5. Compile the software and flash the board.

6. **Optional (add I2C EEPROM support):** Edit **\Marlin\src\pins\stm32f4\pins_BTT_SKR_PRO_V1_1.h** in your firmware root folder and append the text from file that matches your EEPROM size: **\I2C_EEPROM\I2C_4K_EEPROM.h** or **\I2C_EEPROM\I2C_32K_EEPROM.h**.

7. **Optional (applies to users with I2C EEPROM installed):** Do a "Restore failsafe" from the printer's menu to make sure that the printer is running with the default values and avoid malfunction.

## Connecting BL Touch to dedicated on-board header

Below is a picture showing where to connect BL Touch to use the dedicated on-board header. This not required but it leaves both Z end stops ports available if you want to repurpose it. In this case you also need to **follow** **step 3** from the **Installation guide for Printers with BL Touch 3.1**. 

Please note that the on-board header has only 4 pins and that the brown (or blue on some BL Touch kits from Creality) wire (Servo GND) from BL Touch cable **is not connected**.  Also make sure sure that BL Touch it is configured in **open drain mode**.
